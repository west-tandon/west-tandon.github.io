I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Tandon School of Engineering of New York University. I received a Master degree in Computer Science from the University of Pisa in Italy. Before joining the Ph.D. program in the Spring of 2018, I worked as a Software Engineer at the National Research Council (CNR) in Pisa and at Bloomberg L.P in London. I also worked as an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon in Barcellona during Spring 2019.
